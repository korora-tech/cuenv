# Landlock Security Implementation - Production Checklist

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Implemented correct Landlock pattern using pre_exec
- [x] Added support for both filesystem and network restrictions
- [x] Integrated security field parsing in Go bridge
- [x] Added proper error handling and conversions
- [x] Created integration tests
- [x] Added ABI compatibility checking
- [x] Added feature detection helper

## 🔧 Required Before Production

- [ ] Run integration tests on a Landlock-enabled system (kernel 5.13+)
- [ ] Test on systems without Landlock to ensure graceful degradation
- [ ] Update documentation with security configuration examples
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for restricted vs unrestricted execution
- [ ] Consider adding telemetry for Landlock usage/failures

## 📝 Go Bridge Changes

The Go bridge now properly extracts security configuration from CUE tasks:

- restrictDisk: boolean
- restrictNetwork: boolean
- readOnlyPaths: string array
- readWritePaths: string array
- allowedHosts: string array (port numbers as strings)
- allowNew: boolean

## 🚀 Usage Example

```cue
tasks: {
    "secure-task": {
        command: "cat /etc/hosts"
        security: {
            restrictDisk: true
            readOnlyPaths: ["/etc/hosts", "/usr", "/bin"]
        }
    }
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. Network restrictions only support port-based rules (Landlock limitation)
2. Requires Linux kernel 5.13+ for filesystem, 6.7+ for network
3. Some filesystem operations may require additional access rights

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. Always test security restrictions in a safe environment first
2. Use audit mode to understand actual access patterns
3. Be conservative with allowed paths - prefer explicit allowlists
4. Monitor for Landlock failures in production logs
