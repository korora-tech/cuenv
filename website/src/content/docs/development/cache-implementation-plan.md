# Cache System Rewrite Plan

## Overview

The current cache implementation is a mess of half-implemented features, poor abstractions, and production-unready code. This plan outlines a complete rewrite to create a Google-scale, production-grade caching system.

## Current Issues

### Critical Problems

1. **Multiple overlapping abstractions**: ActionCache, CacheManager, ConcurrentCache, ContentAddressedStore all doing similar things
2. **No real concurrency control**: Mixed Arc<Mutex> and Arc<RwLock> without clear ownership model
3. **Memory leaks**: In-memory HashMap with no eviction policy
4. **Poor error handling**: unwrap() calls in production paths
5. **Inefficient storage**: JSON serialization instead of binary formats
6. **No compression**: Wasting disk space with uncompressed data
7. **Async/sync confusion**: Hacky run_async() workarounds
8. **Security theater**: Signing implemented but not consistently verified

### Performance Issues

1. **No streaming**: Loading entire files into memory
2. **No parallelism**: Sequential cache operations
3. **Poor cache keys**: Including unnecessary environment variables
4. **No sharding**: Single-file bottlenecks for concurrent access
5. **No metrics**: Can't measure cache effectiveness

## Phase 1: Clean Architecture Design

### Goals

- Single, unified cache interface
- Clear separation of concerns
- Production-grade error handling
- Proper async/sync boundaries

### Deliverables

1. Remove all "v2" naming and half-implemented features
2. Design new `Cache` trait with clear semantics
3. Implement proper error types with recovery strategies
4. Create clear async/sync boundaries without hacks

### Implementation

- Delete redundant implementations
- Create single `Cache` struct that owns all cache functionality
- Implement proper `CacheError` enum with recovery hints
- Use tokio::task::spawn_blocking for sync/async bridge

## Phase 2: Storage Backend

### Goals

- Efficient binary storage format
- Compression support
- Atomic operations
- Corruption recovery

### Deliverables

1. Binary format using bincode or similar
2. Zstd compression for all cached data
3. Write-ahead log for crash recovery
4. Checksums on all stored data

### Implementation

- Replace JSON with bincode serialization
- Add zstd compression with configurable levels
- Implement WAL for atomic multi-file updates
- Add CRC32C checksums to detect corruption

## Phase 3: Concurrency & Performance

### Goals

- Lock-free reads where possible
- Sharded storage for parallelism
- Streaming APIs for large files
- Zero-copy operations

### Deliverables

1. Lock-free concurrent HashMap using dashmap
2. Sharded file storage (256 shards by key hash)
3. Streaming read/write APIs
4. Memory-mapped files for hot data

### Implementation

- Replace Mutex/RwLock with dashmap for in-memory index
- Shard cache files into 256 buckets by first byte of hash
- Implement AsyncRead/AsyncWrite traits for streaming
- Use memmap2 for frequently accessed data

## Phase 4: Eviction & Memory Management

### Goals

- Configurable eviction policies
- Memory pressure handling
- Disk space management
- Cache warming

### Deliverables

1. LRU/LFU/ARC eviction policies
2. Memory limit enforcement
3. Disk quota management
4. Background cache warming

### Implementation

- Implement configurable eviction strategies
- Monitor system memory and adjust cache size
- Track disk usage and enforce quotas
- Prefetch likely cache entries in background

## Phase 5: Remote Cache Integration

### Goals

- Transparent remote cache support
- Multi-tier caching (L1/L2/L3)
- Distributed cache protocol
- Fault tolerance

### Deliverables

1. gRPC-based cache protocol
2. Local/remote cache federation
3. Consistent hashing for distribution
4. Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### Implementation

- Design protobuf schema for cache protocol
- Implement cache client/server with tonic
- Add consistent hashing for key distribution
- Implement circuit breakers and retries

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Observability

### Goals

- Detailed performance metrics
- Cache effectiveness tracking
- Debugging capabilities
- Performance profiling

### Deliverables

1. Prometheus metrics export
2. OpenTelemetry tracing
3. Cache hit rate analysis
4. Performance flamegraphs

### Implementation

- Add prometheus metrics for all operations
- Instrument with OpenTelemetry spans
- Track per-task cache effectiveness
- Add pprof endpoints for profiling

## Phase 7: Security & Integrity

### Goals

- Cryptographic integrity verification
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Tamper detection

### Deliverables

1. Ed25519 signatures on all entries
2. Capability-based access control
3. Audit log of all cache operations
4. Merkle tree for tamper detection

### Implementation

- Sign all cache entries with Ed25519
- Implement capability tokens for access
- Log all operations to append-only audit log
- Build Merkle tree of cache contents

## Phase 8: Testing & Validation

### Goals

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Chaos testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Production validation

### Deliverables

1. Unit tests with 100% coverage
2. Property-based tests with proptest
3. Chaos monkey for fault injection
4. Performance regression suite

### Implementation

- Write exhaustive unit tests
- Add property-based tests for invariants
- Implement chaos testing framework
- Create performance benchmark suite

## Phase 9: Production Hardening

### Goals

- Graceful degradation
- Self-healing capabilities
- Operations playbook
- SRE integration

### Deliverables

1. Automatic corruption recovery
2. Self-tuning parameters
3. Runbook for common issues
4. SLO/SLI definitions

### Implementation

- Add automatic repair on corruption
- Implement adaptive tuning algorithms
- Write comprehensive operations guide
- Define and monitor SLOs

## Phase 10: Advanced Features

### Goals

- Predictive caching
- Cross-platform support
- Multi-tenancy
- Advanced analytics

### Deliverables

1. ML-based cache prediction
2. Windows/macOS optimizations
3. Tenant isolation
4. Cache analytics dashboard

### Implementation

- Train model on access patterns
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Implement tenant namespacing
- Build analytics dashboard

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: 10x faster than current implementation
2. **Reliability**: 99.99% cache availability
3. **Scalability**: Support 1M+ cached entries
4. **Efficiency**: 50% reduction in disk usage via compression
5. **Correctness**: Zero data corruption or cache poisoning

## Timeline

- Phase 1-3: Core implementation (1 week)
- Phase 4-6: Performance & monitoring (1 week)
- Phase 7-8: Security & testing (1 week)
- Phase 9-10: Production readiness (1 week)

Total: 4 weeks to production-ready state

## Migration Strategy

1. Implement new cache alongside old
2. Add feature flag for gradual rollout
3. Run in shadow mode to validate
4. Migrate task-by-task
5. Remove old implementation

This plan ensures we build a cache system worthy of replacing Bazel at Google scale.
